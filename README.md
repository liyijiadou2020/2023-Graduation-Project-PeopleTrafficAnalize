2023 Graduation Project: A store traffic analysis system based on pytorch and opencv

This is an implementation of a store traffic statistics system. Implemented cross-camera multi-target tracking, basing on:
- Yolov5 - person detection
- DeepSORT - multiple object tracking
- FastReID - Person re-identification

#### In this project using follow models:
1. yolov5x pre-trained model
2. DeepSORT model, trained on dataset MARKET1501
3. FastReid model, The reid model is trained by the fast-reid framework, resnet34 distilled from resnet101

#### How to run
